Question:
Given a string of lowercase English letters and an integer of the substring length,
determine the substring of that length that contains the most vowels. Vowels are in
the set {a, e, i, o, u}. If there is more than one substring with the maximum number
of vowels, return the one that starts at the lowest index. If there are no vowels in
the input string, return the string 'Not found!'without quotes.
Example I
s = taberqiitefg'
The substring of length k = 5that contains the maximum number of vowels is 'erqii'
with 3 vowels.
The final answer is 'erqii'.
Example 2
s = äeiouia'
All of the characters are vowels, so any substring of length 3 will have 3 vowels. The
lowest index substring is at index O, 'aei'.

Question:
Given an array of integers, what is the length of the longest subarray containing no
more than two distinct values such that the distinct values differ by no more than
l?
Example
arr= [0, 1,2,
The largest such subarray has length 4: [I 1 ,2].
The largest such subarray has length 4: [3, 3, 2, 2]. The values I and 3 differ by
more than I so [I, I, I, 3, 3] is not valid.
Function Description
Complete the function longestSubarrayin the editor below.
longestSubarrayhas the following parameter(s):
intarr[n]: an array of integers
Returns:
int: the length of the longest subarray
Constraints
• The longest subarray will have fewer than 35 elements.
